# Optimizer-Study
This is for beginners starting ML like me, can follow this to have better understanding in Optimizers used in Neural Networks.  

1. In **Optimizer_Study.pdf** file I have explained how all popular optimizers work.I have also made comparision between them through which you can make decision which one should be selected for your algorithm.
2. The **Optimizer_Study.ipynb** file is the implementation of the same, you can observe their behaviour on a given prediction model i.e. on a "House Price" prediction.
3. The **houseprice.csv** file the a data used for prediction model. You are encouraged to upload the same when you are using that code.
